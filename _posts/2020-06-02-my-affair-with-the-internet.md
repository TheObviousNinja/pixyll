***What does a "typical interaction" with the internet look like on an average day in my life?***

<p class="justify">Messaging – Scrolling through social media sites like Instagram, Twitter etc – Engaging with video and music content on Youtube, Spotify, Prime Video – Ordering stuff online through any of the e-commerce sites – and ofcourse, web searching and consuming the content that shows up on those links.</p>

So now, Why, How and Who is out there, setting up this crazy infrastructure, with servers and databases and their optimised algorithms, aggregating, assimilating and readying this ocean of data just to feed me this endless sea of content, all within a single tap? Mind you, it is also almost free of charge. I only pay my ISP for, one: their cables, gateways, and a bunch of other devices used to connect me to the servers and two: the speed they offer me my internet; which is nominal compared to what the internet actually gives me. Also, I didn’t forget those sites that charge us for their content, like Netflix, Spotify, some news sites etc but I still include them in my list because I’m not mean and they care about me too. **But, yes, the rest of the internet, is free\***.

Do they secretly know that I’m a miser and that I won’t be paying if the internet was actually charging me for every Google search I made? Maybe they do. Because clearly, they do know I like watching funny cat videos(I mean who doesn’t? Cats are stupid and funny) and that I like those black headphones which I scouted the internet over for the cheapest offers. So, someone has been secretly, not-stalking me (won’t expose them like that), I’d say admiring me and noting down my every move online so as to provide me all sorts of content just to keep me engaged, entertained, comfortable, procrastinated or to sum it all up, keep me on a dopamine-high day in and day out. How selfless, how invested, how dedicated.. I am impressed and more so, I am blushing.

(Muffled shy giggles) “O Internet, stop.. Be a little discreet. You sure know how to keep me happy and I would never want for this to end”. 

I don’t verbally say any of this but it’s understood as I smile while I swipe through cute puppy pictures on Instagram, whilst listening to a curated playlist on Spotify with those black headphones that arrived last week through Amazon, all whilst I am waiting for my movie download to complete on Prime Video.

You, a sympathetic person, shaking your head in disapproval while looking at my love-stoned stupid self shamelessly flirting with the internet, come up and try to engage in a private conversation with me.

“You do know that there’s a price you’re paying for this, right?”

I remove my headphones, pause my music, and ask with eager curiosity, “and what exactly is that price?”

“It is you, yourself. You’re the price.”

Me, totally unimpressed, without batting an eyelid, says, “I know that. Tell me something new.”.

“But why are you doing this to yourself?”

I, take a deep breath, and tell you that of course, this was going to come at a price. At the cost of my online privacy, at the cost of me being analysed as views, clicks, taps, scrolls, texts, searches, cookies and logins, to keep me on every platform for as long as possible, to keep me in that transient state of happiness that I get while laughing at a meme, just so that they can slip in that ad about a pair of jeans right after the meme, hoping that I engage with it too, which would give them big bucks and keep all their infrastructure running. Ads are what keeps them running, and for those ads, they need me – hooked and addicted, to stay long enough, and have me coming back for more. So they bait me.

At first, I was shocked. I felt exploited and betrayed when I read about this a few years ago. But the internet was here to stay and I was addicted to the high. There were two things that I could have done. One, call this affair off. Go cold turkey by doing an Internet detox and only engage as minimally as possible. But come on, I’m not that rude of a person and to be honest, I wasn’t just flirting, I was in love. With the internet. (Lowkey, it was literally withdrawal symptoms, because I was bloody addicted). So the second option is what I curated for myself.

I gladly accepted this trap. If I was being “exploited”, I wanted it to be both ways. You want to force content on me just to keep me online, then you listen to me and give me better cat videos and take that annoying ASMR mukbang recommendation off of my Youtube feed. Give me more aesthetic-life-quote posts and remove those Tiktok challenge videos off of my Instagram feed. This way it became more of a mutual understanding than an exploiter-vs-exploited situation.

So now, I actively tell Youtube to stop recommending uninteresting channels and videos to me. I tell Instagram about posts that don’t interest me. I downvote/dislike songs on music stations that don't align to my taste or mood and I tell Pinterest what exactly about a post I dislike(since she asks me for the details).

Also to be honest, ads are rarely interesting, but if found to be otherwise, I will engage with them, guilt-free because they are actually serving me their purpose.

However, if I see something too uninteresting, I wouldn’t ever hover my cursor over it, let alone engage with it in the slightest way possible. For ads and posts that are blatantly explicit, hateful, annoying or totally irrelevant, I literally click the ‘stop seeing this ad’ option. I even extended this to my email accounts. They were initially flooded with annoying promotions and random subscriptions only because I was too naive or rather too lazy to uncheck the ‘I-will-spam-the-life-out-of-you-with-annoying-updates’ box while signing up for something. But now, I am more wary. I either uncheck, or I actually go to my inbox when I get a new email notification(ie. spam), scroll to the unsubscribe link at the bottom and actually unsubscribe. I even turn off unnecessary email notifications from other sites because I engage with websites **when I decide to** and not every time someone comments on a Facebook post that I was tagged in with 50 other people. If they were that important, Facebook will show me those notifications(only if they are enabled as well) when I log in. So no thanks default-enabled-email-notifications.

So, have I become kind-of OCD with my online space now? Hell yeah. But I am smug about it. Because I still get my dopamine while I am royally procrastinating and now its with better quality content, just perfect for my liking. So its a win-win for me and the internet. We exploit each other and we love it.

And mind you, this is a dynamic cycle, because while the internet is constantly trying to figure me out, I’m changing too. Yesterday, I was scouting the internet for articles on raising bunnies, and today I am no longer interested in that after finding out they multiply exponentially within a few months.(Clearly, I was planning to buy a bunch of them, because having one pet bunny is too sad and everyone deserves friends).

Also, ofcourse, I shouldn’t be procrastinating like this while I could actually be reading a book or gymming or something. But hey, that’s for a different blog post. Besides, right now I am procrastinating by writing this just to keep you engaged with this post long enough so that you can be recommended more enlightening(aka silly) articles like this and that can be used to keep the internet running and in turn keep my affair going swell.

Having said all that, I end my dialogue.

And you, pause, and either agree with me or you give me the ‘what-a-retard’ face and walk away while I put on my headphones and get ready to watch the movie that finished downloading on Prime Video.

***PS: In case you didn’t notice, I added an asterisk when I said that the rest of the internet is free and in case you did notice, niceee work. But if you didn’t understand why I added that asterisk or why I wrote this article, then send me an email. I will mark it as spam.***
