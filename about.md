Bengalurean. Computer Science Engineer. Chai Lover.

Currently, in China, surviving Covid-19 and researching about the best way to make tea with the help of Data Science.

Ever so often, I find myself looking away from my work, riding on this random train of thought about something I’ve seen, read, heard or just some figment of my imagination. Though reticent in nature, I do have a kink for breaking my own stereotype.

So this is where I share excerpts of the random banters I have with myself.

And, I also share projects that I manage to complete in bouts of productivity in between my procrastination schedule.
